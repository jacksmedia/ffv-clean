Hello, these hacks offer interface & gameplay adjustments in FFV (English) to make for a Cleaner experience.

Apply any of the "FFV Clean" patches to an *unheadered* copy of FFVJ.sfc-- the checksum & CRC data are these:

File/ROM CRC32: C1BC267D

(Use https://www.romhacking.net/hash/ to check these values, and use the Tush utility available on rhdn to remove a header if needed.)

REBRANDED VARIANTS

Very Clean & Hella Clean are the new variants that add extra accessibility to the original FFV. Hella is the more extreme, with more effective Stealing and extra weapon equips for all Jobs; they both make previously weak weapons more powerful.

----

Control, Menu, Etc Improvements:

+ use Menu button to pass turn in battle

+ Dash in towns and dungeons with all jobs (Thief/Dash is faster)

+ L & R buttons page scroll Item and Magic Menus

+ Blue Magic has its own icon (Diamond)

+ Many icons improved (some courtesy of tsushiy)

+ Espers have Black/White/Time icons by effect type

+ Many Ability, item and enemy names now match their appearance elsewhere in the FF series

+ All Jobs and Abilities have descriptions

+ The 12 items that work with !Mix command are more obvious

+ Equipment Weight works the same as in Pixel Remaster edition (it's 2x more impactful in reducing Agility now)

+ FFV: MSU-1 chip support added for enhanced soundtracks (not included, DYOR)

----
1. Clean Battle Improvements:

+ Berserk doesn't merely Attack: can work with Jump, Mug, SwdSlap, Dance, Aim, RapidFire

+ Check works as described, showing elemental weakness

+ "Surge" Time spell replaces pointless "Drag"; free to cast and restores 12 MP

+ SwdSlap hits like a normal Attack and may stun the target; it doesn't remove Sleep, Confuse, or Control

+ Images can stack up to 3 (still 2 per cast or Ability)


2. Very Clean Battle Improvements, the above plus...

+ Harps, Bells, Rods, Whips, Knives, Spears all do more damage

+ Axes, Katana, Hammers, even some Knives work with MagicSword

+ Spears and some other new options work with Double Grip; Dbl.Grip combos with Jump for additional damage


3. Hella Clean Battle Improvements, the above plus...

+ Stealing is significantly more effective

+ All Jobs except Monk & Mime gain at least one more weapon they can wield

Bugfixes:
Kiss of Blessings, PowerDrink, HP Drain limit and many other glitches were properly addressed by open source patches. Please read the changelog to see them all, and for all other details.

Very & Hella Clean are intended to provide less restrictive versions of the game, and will continue development as forks of the main Clean project. They are made possible thanks to Modoh's "Weapon Formula Tweaks" & Gens' "Improved Steal" work.

CHANGELOG NOTES
v1.96
+ Hella Clean: new equipment for Jobs & improved Steal rate
+ new font options
+ option to access Lix as soon as the Wind Shrine (apply that patch)
+ Cid looks like his Y.Amano design
+ Bard songs finally aligned with FFVA
+ some weapons aligned with FFVA names (long overdue)



FFV v1.95x
+ Incredible map sprites that show the Jobs (all work by Cubear)
+ New Krile battle sprites
= Fixed some typos (thanks RoSoDude, thanks BladePotato!)
+ Small script tweaks in Tule
= Config Menu debugged of color highlight glitch
+ New font from the FF5r Clean project for menus.
+ New icons borrowed from FF5R-IC and FF6-T.


Prior versions
--------------
FFV v1.91
Renamed "SoftHit" back to SwdSlap, bc the move actually works like SwdSlap (I missed this in last version update)

"All" restored for 2nd option in Config, Reequip menu

Fixed 2 typos in menus where the ":" was floating over the word "Equip" so it looked like "Eq:ip"-- it looks like "Equip:" now.



FFV v1.9
----
SwdSlap works (thanks to forensic work by RoSoDude, who figured out which parts of Inu's patches weren't cooperating w existing Clean Edition patches, and created workarounds)! Enjoy Samurai as the developers (presumably) intended! And don't forget that it jives with Berserk!

Bugfixed dialog/speech-- the "ie" went missing last update when I mistakenly changed the font~plaintext crosswalk file.

Passive Abilities list their stat boosts in their descriptions now. Many Equip Abilities may surprise you.

Added 3 custom recolors to Faris's Jobs (MNK is darker, WHM is hoodless, DRG is dark green not candy red), plus a vanilla restore patch.


FFV v1.88
----
SwdSlap removed because downstream issues existed, most notably the opening fights against the 1 HP Golbins became unwinnable... those enemies mysteriously set Stun every time they hit, which is an unintended side-effect glitch of the sequence of patches used.
Until this is properly debugged, SwdSlap will remain "SoftHit", meaning it's a normal strength attack that doesn't interrupt Control, Sleep, nor Confuse-- but does not have a chance to set Paralyze status.

Icon improvements to Ribbon, Bag, and most status effect icons.

Removed the ABC/abc options in character naming screen.


FFV v1.87 & v1.86
----
!SwdSlap fixed via complex (to me at least ;_;) patching sequence using Inu's work, thanks to assistance from RoSoDude.
A few small script improvements, as usual.

Typos addressed and script improvements continue!
Some typos fixed like in the opening movie, where a line ran off the screen. >_<

The Healing Staff scene and the 'Hiryuu' healing scene atop North Mountain were both improved.
Two custom NPC graphic changes in FFV, in the Wind Shrine (Wind Sage) and in Carwen (Mayor); done w ff6tools.
( https://everything8215.github.io/ff6tools/ff6tools.html )


ICON Revision, Version 1.85:
----
Icon upgrade to all 12 items that work with !Mix...

Healing items that work with !Mix now have the "potion" icon!
[Potion]Potion
[Potion]Hi-Potion
[Potion]PhnxDown
[Potion]Ether
[Potion]Elixir
[Potion]Antidote
[Potion]Eyedrop
[Potion]MaidKiss
[Potion]HolyWater

These 3 Mix items got their own new icon (a bag)
[Bag]TurtlShell
[Bag]DrgnFang
[Bag]DarkMatter 

(The twice-used [Key] that occurs in the Rare Items list was repurposed for this [Bag]. The Castle Key and Torna Canal Key now just have the word "Key" and no icon.)

These 5 Drink items have lost their Potion icon, and gained the word "Drink". It makes more sense to highlight Mix-ables and the 5 Drinks are easier to remember, by far.

PowerDrink
ProtectDrink
SpeedDrink
HeroDrink
GiantDrink

And yes, GoldNeedle and LuckMallet don't work with !Mix so they have no icons.
Hope this change helps you to enjoy !Mix as much as it helps me!


SCRIPT Version 1.84 updates:
----
* Full Dialog/Script revision complete in FFV Clean Editions!! Dozens of typos and ugly dialog boxes fixed!
Used noisecross's amazing FF5 Text Editor, available here:

https://www.ff6hacking.com/ff5wiki/index.php/Main_Page 

+ Eqp.Wgt stat now reduces Agility by 1 point for every 4 points of Eqp.Wgt; this doesn't happen in Deeper Clean, it was left like FFV Vanilla (which is 1 point of Agi for every 8 points of Eqp.Wgt).
Special thanks to RoSoDude for sharing his unpublished patch that makes this change to add strategic depth to the armor choice!

+ Fixed Headers thanks to a utility provided by Kandowontu, a true mensch and ally to all romhackers.

+ Small edits to Ability/Job descriptions: !Focus, Blue Mage both more accurate now.

+ Changed NPC sprite (& name) in the Wind Shrine (Chancellor can't be there & also at Tycoon Castle)! To edit the rom like this, I used the astonishing editor at:

https://everything8215.github.io/ff6tools/ff6tools.html

and you can, too ^_^ Open your rom as the FF5 RPGe option, and **Save backup copies of your work, fam!**


BUFGIX Version 1.83 updates:

(If you are using the Cleaner Font patch in your project, please note that Scroll & Diamond icons have shifted to new locations. All the new double letter tiles will show up in Battle messages, so feel free to use them in Ability, Spell and etc names!)
