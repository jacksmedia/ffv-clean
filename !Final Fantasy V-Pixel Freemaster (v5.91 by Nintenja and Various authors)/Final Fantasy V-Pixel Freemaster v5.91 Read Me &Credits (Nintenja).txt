Final Fantasy V Pixel Freemaster and Final Fantasy V-Pixel Freemaster-Kick Butz Edition (v5.91)
(hack by Nintenja and Various authors)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Word from Nintenja the creator/releaser of this Project:
Final Fantasy V is a masterpiece I first played over 20 years ago as a teenager on the Sony Playstation 1. It was a long grind to max out all job classes 
but it was worth it. I sought to create the ultimate version of Final Fantasy V for the SNES (or really any console). I recently bought and played the 
Pixel Remaster of FF5 on Android and noted the lack controller support.. Fans have requested this option and those without a pc and who must play 
FF5 on Android are surely not getting their wishes granted, as well there are many QOL hacks for the game only available for the SNES version.. 
So, in yearning to put together the most Butz kicking Edition of FF5, I added every QOL feature one could dream of to this game including all
the bugfixes, improved sprites, MSU1 v4 patch for CD quality, and the improved GBA translation v1.16 patch. Than further QOL patches like the 
better item menu and auto patches such as auto learning, auto dash,auto map, auto pits, and auto passages among others really improved gameplay 
and were added. Better job equipment makes life a little easier for some classes as well. Sick of missing out I added the no missable items and spells 
patches. To top all this off I added the double xp,abp,and gil patch to make progression less grindy. You can stop here and have a fine Pixel Freemaster, 
however, Optionally Maybe go a step further adding the all Jobs unlocked patch which unlocks every job right after the wind shrine is completed, however, 
this is the Kick Butz Edition and boy is it awesome having them so early on..if you feel it's too early for all the job classes to be unlocked and usable than 
simply exercise restraint and use them only after the points you actually would have received them in the vanilla version or just apply the Pixel Freemaster 
version (without all jobs unlocked) which does not include all Jobs unlocked. In version 3.0 I took it a step further for both Pixel Freemaster Versions. 
Borrowing from an idea from the FFV Tweaks (hack by T92) forum on RHDN I found INU's amazing little known QOL patches from 2010 and patched them 
in giving both versions L+R character switching in Menu (a Godsend), faster menu scrolling speed, the ability to switch characters in battle with a Full ATB 
Guage using the X button like in FF6 (really helps in strategizing), the ability to hold B to run on the world map, a total item slot counter displayed on the 
items menu like in FF6, and Color Changing HP in battle as Hp percentage decreases. In version 4.00 I added in Inu's optimise patch for better equipment 
optimization as well as a New Game Plus Mode. In v4.33 I added in two Inu patches the equip change patch which automatically collects items that were 
removed due to equipment changes during battle and an equip change fix. In version 4.50 I fixed a cosmetic issue with the configuration menu brought to 
my attention by playtester and RHDN username Tombo69. In version 4.85 I replaced the useless drag spell with a temporary level up caster by 7 levels spell 
renamed "level".I also added Super Custom Classes by flampepurge to all versions to make each job more customizable.  If you are grinding or farming for 
levels, abp, or gil  you should make sure to have Fight as one of your equipped skils and than make sure you can go to the config menu in game and change 
the cursor setting from reset to memory to make the game automatcially have fight or whatever move you want automatically selected for each character. 
In version 4.99 I have added many features into both versions of the hack including: Fast rom support by Kandowontu, Clean Warriors by (Cubear,XJ4cks, 
and various others) so now ALL MAP SPRITES REFLECT JOBS, Mime Galuf Battle Sprite patch 1.0 by clymax which creates a playable sprite of Galuf for the 
mime job, Pantz n Sleeves_Final by XJ4cks, and added an optional patch that includes coop controller sharing hack by STARWIN. In version 5.0 I added the newest 
version of Dress code v1.0(beta) by Cubear which improves job class sprites and also makes map sprites reflect job sprites, ported GBA Script Blue Diamonds (Blue 
Diamond icons for Blue Magic), GBA Script Clean Weapons by xJ4cks which makes some improvements to item names amongst fixing some GBA script typos, and 
now characters in the games menu are in boxes like in Pixel Remaster. In version 5.20 with help from xJ4cks the Title screen now says Pixel Freemaster (original title 
screen version is available as an optional version). In version 5.55 I added Inu's Berserk Patch (ff5 berserk command) as well as two patches by Inu that itdepended on 
ff5 auto jump+ff5 berserk jump. I also added ff5 swdslap standalone by RosoDude (fixes issue) and FFV Clean Krile&Lenna fixed by xJ4cks. In version 5.59 we fixed a bug 
that made Bartz name appear as a boomerang at the start of the game (Thanks xJ4cks), added an optional no auto passages and no auto find pits patch, as well as an 
optional rstore vanilla title screen patch. In version 5.70  xJ4cks fixed made berzerker job work better as well as made an optional patch that changes the Time Magic 
Level up spell to a +1 LVL up for 7MP that should provide alternativeto the current +7 lvl LVl up spell for 4MP. Included optional patches that add co-op controller 
sharing hack (STARWIN). Version 5.77 was a rebuild of the entirety of the project going back to v5.00. This version was released to RHDN AND RHDO. Version 5.78 
includes (optional) BSNES 60hz fix (clymax). Version 5.80 has the optional 2x ABP,XP,GIL Patch by C_CLIFF nut now the GFX glitch it causes in battle is gone thanks to
CLYMAX! Version 5.81 Clymax expands upon his fix with another fix making things work perfectly in the optional 2XABP,XP,GIL patch. Version 5.82 adds in an optional 
patch by Cubear that turns off random encounters, however pressing the start button and taking one step will load a random encounter. Version 5.88 includes an optional 
START Button starts Encounters (Cubear) patch where encounters remain at their original rates but when u press the Start button and walk one step a random encounter will 
trigger. This is great for grinding as instead of the game deciding when u would like yournext battle you can instead force a battle. V5.88 also includes an optional L&R Button 
Leader Swap (Cubear) which swaps the leader in maps. It may have an issue or two needs fixing so its optional for now. It's a super cool hack. Version 5.91 includes an updated 
LR Leader swap by Cubear that fixes some issues. I believe these additional add-ons bring this project to a level on par or greater than an official release of FFV that recently 
released. I hope you enjoy what I personally feel is one of the greatest versions of FFV to date. I have a great deal of respect and gratitude for the video game rom hacking 
community so I hope people playing this will enjoy and appreciate all the work put into this project by everyone whose work is included here as well as my own efforts. 
This project has tons of hours of extra tweaking, tinkering, hacking, testing, patching, merging, porting, moving, bug fixing, and time sprinkled in for good measure. I hope 
you enjoy this Pixel Freemaster as much as I have and make sure to thank and follow all the authors whose included in this work.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE/INSTALLATION:
Visit https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/ or any .ips patching software.
*On Android you can use unipatcher which is available in the play store.

1.Open the unheadered Final Fantasy V (J) rom
I applied the patches to a "FFV (J)" unheadered rom and everything seemed great
CRC32:  c1bc267d
MD5:  d69b2115e17d1cf2cb3590d3f75febb9
SHA-1:  e937b54fff99838e2e853697e4f559359aa91fd6

2.Open the Final Fantasy V-Pixel Freemaster or Final Fantasy V-Pixel Freemaster-Kick Butz Edition.ips patch

3.Apply the patch (your choice of all Jobs unlocked or all jobs not unlocked).(I cannot give location instructions for where to get the rom other than Google search maybe if you wanna-up to you)

4.In "Optional" folder pick any hacks that interest you and patch them after the main patch.

It is recommended to use this with MSU1 Audio as this is already patched for msu1 playback. Such as the Pixel Remaster MSU1 audio pack by Brutapode 
https://mega.nz/file/UD5iHZoT#ShQSVGn-9RPCSsGhlo_4m0RAaZ-5JS8Cu2c1eybzGxk
or various other MSU1 sound packs (choice is Up to you)
https://www.zeldix.net/t2070-final-fantasy-v
This version should work fine with or without MSU1 audio files.

Just pick which MSU1 pack you would like to use and rename the patched rom appropriately to match the msu files for CD quality sound. Nintenja 
does not own the audio sound packs nor did he create them and is not giving you permission to use them. 

Rom extensively tested with MSU1 Audio pack on SNES9X emulator for android.

 Mime Galuf Battle Sprites on FFV v1.0
Released by Clymax
 https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/8668/
Description from Clymax:
 Mime Galuf isn’t accessible via normal means in the vanilla game. So, the developers didn’t bother with making battle sprites for that combo.
Any tinkerer who’s tried using Mime Galuf will discover what ensues. Galuf turns invisible in battle and menu, but the game remains (otherwise) playable.
This patch adds the “missing” battle sprites to the game.

FFV Co-Op Controller Sharing v1.0
Released by STARWIN
https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/2122/
Description:
This hack allows the players to determine who controls the game outside battles: whoever controls the character in the first slot will have control.
This does not affect battles. Changing character order or changing character ownership will immediately swap control accordingly.
That is all this does. The game already has controller sharing for battles and controller choosing for characters.

MSU-1 Patch by Conn (v4: sd2snes resume fixed):
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1o2XQfHcLWnFp6c8KJsa6HOKgLL51tQO5

Final Fantasy V - GBA Script Port v1.16
Released By J121
https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/3687/
Description from J121:
As the name implies, this hack is a complete port of the English GBA games script over the original RPGe fan translation, using Noisecross FFe 
Text Editor v1.6. This hack replaces all in-game field text, battle text, spell names, item names, monster names etc. with their relevant GBA equivalents, 
except where compromises had to be made to accommodate the stricter space limitations of the SNES game. An attempt was made to prefer new creative 
names over jarring abbreviations where necessary to fit space limitations. Graphics for the fonts were also edited, with the main variable-width font replaced 
with the thin font from Earthbound, purely because it allowed more space for text, especially in battle. NOTE: As of v1.04, this font has been replaced with a 
thin font that resembles the font from FF4, for greater consistency.

FFV GBA Script Port Fix - Static Bartz in Dialog
Released By Kouga47
https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/6005/
Description from Kouga47:
In the fantastic GBA Script port hack, there are three instances where the name shown in the dialogue for the main character is Bartz, his default 
name, no matter if you changed his name or not at the beginning of the game. This patch should fix that issue. 

BUGFIXES
various bugfixes sourced from slickproductions.org, as well as those
included in noisecross' FF5e text editor.
They are as follows:
 - Caught monster display
 - Catch bug fix
 - Kiss of Blessing bug fix
 - Power Drink bug fix
 - Observe bug fix
 - Bartz's blue mage sprite fix
 - Berserk chicken knife fix
 - Two Galufs fix
 - Faster common death animation
 - Fractional M parameter knife fix (http://slickproductions.org/slickwiki/index.php/FF5_Patch:Fractional_M)
 - Walk through walls fix
 - Landing fix
See http://slickproductions.org/slickwiki/index.php/Final_Fantasy_V_Hacking#Patches for more information.
Also included is an optional patch that makes Galuf's hair consistently ginger. Again, this should be patched OVER the main
patch.

Quick Death v1.6
Released By Leet Sketcher
https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/3216/
Description from. Leet Sketcher:
When you kill an enemy, it dies using the slowest animation possible: a two-second long dissolve. Since the GBA versions dissolve animation is much 
faster, this patch makes the SNES dissolve fast also.

Final Fantasy V bugfix patch collection v1.0
Released by Inu
https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/3766/
Description from Inu:
This is a collection of bugfix and improvement patches for the Japanese version of Final Fantasy V for the Super Famicom from Inus

FFV Sprite Touch-ups v1.03
Released By	Chicken Knife
https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/4537/
Description from Chicken Knife:
This is a hack of Final Fantasy V that addresses over 90 minor graphical errors and inconsistencies in the battle sprites for characters across every job. 
The errors include items like a blue pixel present in Bartzs hair in one of his Bare animation frames or flickering pixels during numerous attack 
animations in arms, legs and bodies. This hack strives to bring the overall quality of FFVs battle sprites up to the more polished standard of FFIV and FFVI.

FF5 Better Item Menu v1.0
Released By Tzepish
https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/6818/
Description from Tzepish:
This patch is an edit of Inus item menu patches to make them compatible with all versions of Final Fantasy 5, not just the Japanese version. It has two 
effects:
https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/3766/- First, it greys out the Tent and Cottage items in situations where they cannot be used (such as in a dungeon or 
town while not on a save point).
- Second, it improves the equipment Sort order, so that instead of giving you a pile of weapons followed by a pile of armors, it groups them together based 
on their leading icon, like how FF6 does it. This makes the item menu much more readable!

FF5 Automatic Sprint, Learning, etc. v1.1
Released By Tzepish
https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/3746/
Description from Tzepish:
These patches are small convenience enhancements for Final Fantasy 5. They ensure that the Sprint(or Dash) and Learning
abilities are always considered active, allowing you to devote your precious ability slots to other things.
Version 1.1 adds a few other oft-requested patches (and one not-so requested patch):
Reverse Sprint button check (Sprint by default; hold B to walk)
Always Find Pits
Always Passages
Always Map

Final Fantasy V: Better Job Equipment v2.1
Released By T92
https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/6710/
Description from T92:
This patch improves the range of weapons that can be equipped by some jobs, some based on previous Final Fantasy games and some based on other 
similar jobs; check out the readme file for more info.

FF5 No Missable Items & Spells v1.0
Released By Tzepish
https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/6893/
Description from Tzepish:
Shops Patch: Adds the missable spells and non-unique missable items to shops throughout the game.
Monster/Treasure Patch: Relocates unique missable items that can be missed to non-missable boss drops and treasure chests.

FF5 Job Unlocker v1.0 (only in Kick Butz Edition)
Created by Modoh
https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/6926/
Description from Modoh:
Simple hack that unlocks all of the jobs in FF5 as soon as you open your menu.
Intended for Fiesta playthroughs where you're assigned random jobs to use, and may want to use them before they're unlocked normally.

FFV Pixel Freemaster Title Screen Patch by xJ4cks

Bartz intro boomerang name bug fix by Cubear and xJ4cks
 
 (optional)*No encounters (press START+Walk for Encounter)(Cubear) Exactly what it says, there will be no more random encounters in the game. However 
if you would like to force an encounter at any time just press Start and walk a step and an encounter will be forced. This puts you in complete control
of when you fight a battle outside boss fights and scripted encounters such as the 2 goblins you fight to start the game.

(optional)*START Button starts Encounters (Cubear) encounters remain at their original rates but when u press the Start button and walk one step an
encoutner will trigger. This is great for grinding as instead of the game deciding when u would like yournext battle you can instead force a battle.

(optional)2X ABP,XP,GIL (C_CLIFF) Fixes by CLYMAX v1.1

(optional) L&R Button Leader Swap (Cubear) which swaps the leader in maps. 
It may have an issue or two needs fixing so its optional for now. It's a super cool hack

 (optional) Co-op Controller Sharing by Starwin v1.0
 
 (optional)BSNES 60hz fix (clymax)
 
FF5 Double EXP, Gold and ABP v1.0
Released By C_CliFF
https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/5665/
Description from C_CliFF:
This is a simple patch that doubles EXP, gold and ABP to halve grinding.

(optional)FF5 Double EXP, Gold and ABP v1.0  w fixes v1.1 by Clymax

=========================================================
In version 3.0 I also Applied these open source patches created by INU <inuchr@gmail.com> (I tested and they all seem to be working fine)
ff5_atb_switch.ips        Added a function to switch the action order with the X button.
ff5_fast_menu_scroll.ips   increases the scroll speed of regular menus.
ff5_field_dash.ips        Enables B dash on the field map.
ff5_hp_color.ips         Makes the color of HP displayed during battle change according to the percentage of remaining HP.
ff5_items_total.ips.      Like FF6, display the number of items you have in the item menu
ff5_lr_menu-*.ips.       Add LR menu functionality.

In version 4.0 I added 2 more Inu patches:
ff5_optimize.ips  by INU   improves handling of strongest equipment.
ff5_ngplus (new game plus option) 
Per the words of INU (translated to English): "Add strong and new game. After entering L and R on the loading screen, If you select save data you will
 inherit, jobs, abilities, items, magic, money_Play time_Number of monsters defeated_Start the new game"

In version 4.33 I added the following 2 Inu patches and fixed a 
1. ff5_equip_change.ips
Automatically collects items that were removed due to equipment changes during battle.
2. ff5_equip_change fix.ips. (I guess a fix for above patch)

In version 4.50 I fixed an issue with a cosmetic configuration menu bug.
Thanks go to Tombo69 for playtesting and bringing this bug to my attention!

In version 4.85 I made 2x abp,gil,xp an optional version for both Pixel Freemaster and Pixel Freemaster-Kick Butz Edition 
due to a small almost unnoticable graphical bug it creates in the end of each battle right before the battle rewards screen that I'm finding difficult to fix right now.
I would suggest playing the version with the 2x abp,gil,xp patch to grind extra levels, gil, and job classes, but than switch to the non-2x abp,gil,xp edition for regular
gameplay. Saves should  be compatible with both versions. But, if got don't care about the small and barely noticeable graphical bug than
I'd recommend just using the versions with the 2x abp,gil,and xp included. 
*I also added in Super Custom classes https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/5790/ by flamepurge to each version. Description is "A port of the basic features of 
Custom Classes by ludmeister to the SNES version of FFV. Each of the Jobs can now use a wider range of equipment, and the majority are no longer forced to 
use !Fight and !Item. Should work with any version of the game."Basically this let's you customize each job to your liking. A white and black mage for instance 
no longer has to have fight as a command anymore. Make sure if grinding or farmingfor levels, abp, or gil that yiu visit the in game config menu and set the 
cursor to memory to make sure the last command such as Fight is chosen each time automatically when
its a characters turn in battle.
*Added FF5 Replace the Drag/Speed Spell with temporarily raise the caster’s level by 7 patch and renamed it to "level"..Patch by Tzepish.
https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/6858/

In version 4.99  Added Fast Rom Support by Kandowontu which should make the game run smoother in both emulation and console. I Added Clean Warriors by 
Cubear, XJ4cks, and various authors which let you view your characters in their job outfits on all maps including towns and world map.  I Added pantz n sleeves 
final by XJ4cks which does as it says. Added Mime Galuf Battle Sprites by Clymaxwhich gives Galuf a Mime Sprite in battle when playing with the All Jobs Unlocked
 version instead of being invisible. I also Added optional Co-op Controller Sharing by Starwin.

In version 5.0 Added newest version of Dress code v1.0(beta) by Cubear which improves job class sprites and also makes all job class sprites viewable in all maps. Ported 
GBA Script Blue Diamonds (Blue Diamond icons for Blue Magic) and Ported GBA Script Clean Weapons by xJ4cks which makes some improvements to weapon 
names amongst fixing some GBA script typos.
 
In version 5.20 with help from xJ4cks now we have the words Pixel Freemaster on the title screen above Final Fantasy V and also added Inu's ff5_berserk_command.ips patch 
so When attacking in berserk state, if there are commands such as Plunder, Jump, Head Attack, and Aim they will be used instead of "Fight". 

In version 5.55 added ff5 auto jump+ff5 berserk jump by Inu which are needed to make ffv berzerk command
 to work righ tby Inu +ff5 swdslap standalone by RosoDude+FFV Clean Krile&Lenna fixed by xJ4cks

In version 5.59 fixed Bartz beginning of game Boomerang name bug (xj4cks and cubear).
In Version 5.77 made an optional patch to change LVL UP spell to +1LVL up for 7MP (xj4cks). Removed co-op controlling sharing (STARWIN) and included as optional patch.
Fixed berzerker job by xj4cks. 
In version 5.78 included (optional)BSNES 60hz fix (clymax)
In version 5.80/5.81 Clymax fixed the GFX glitch in the DOUBLE XP,ABP,GIL patch by C_Cliff with (included as optional all in one patch)
In version 5.82 added (optional) !No encounters (press start+walk for encounter)(Cubear)
In version 5.88 added (optional) !START Button starts Encounters (Cubear) and (Optional) L&R Button Leader Swap (Cubear)
